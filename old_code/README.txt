This code is over a year old.  The process was Arduino > Serial to MIDI converter > Garageband. I haven't been able to get this sketch to work on Snow Leopard or Lion (I think the problem is related to the serial to MIDI converter, but I don't have time to test).

One problem might be that the new serial to MIDI converter requires the MIDIbus library(?).  If that's the case, here's the link:

Let me know if you get it to work! Or just use the other Arduino sketches in the OSC repo...
